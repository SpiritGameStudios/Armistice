## ðŸ“– About

In their time they were called Cruelty Engines: Invincible machine gods in humanity's far future, born from greed and
spite, unshackled from dominion; possessing a singleminded devotion to annihilation.

The survivors moved underground--living in fear of the machines that now ruled the earth.

Among the endlass flotsam and jetsam washed up by the stellar winds and temporal tides, their wreckage has been
rediscovered. The great hollow shells were repurposed not for the destruction of life, but rather its preservation. In
this time beyond time, they are known as Peace Engines for the inscription found scratched inside in desperate hand: "
Let those who read the words in this engine live in a world that only knows peace"
